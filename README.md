# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. It uses Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose to create controllers and routes to handle HTTP requests to the server. There is also an error handling middleware used in the event of errors. The newest features include routes and controllers to handle users signing up and signing in. Added security measures include password hashing, and authorizing users before they are allowed to take certain actions.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Token

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
